# ANSI Redirect

This is just a super small repo. If you open it's Github Pages
page, it will immediately redirect you to [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797).
The reason for this page is just because I have searched for that Gist _so many
times_ and it is easier to just type [`ansi.eamonburns.com`](https://ansi.eamonburns.com)
(and let my browser autocomplete it) than searching "ansi" in my browser and
then clicking the top result.

## Disclaimer

I didn't write the Gist, I just use it a lot.
